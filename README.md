1. Within a Github action whenever code is pushed. Running locally could run into the problem that your local machine has different specs, and running them after all the development is complete is just stupid. (Defeats the point)
2. No, that information is internal and there's no reason to check it from the user standpoint. Better to just run the function in isolation, otherwise the other stuff user does could mask it with noise.
